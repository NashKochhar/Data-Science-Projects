The aim is to build a Data Warehouse for job posts datasets obtained from reed (UK) and seek (AUS)

Follow steps to build factless Job_DW Warehouse.

1. Run Create_database.sql

2. Run CreateTableRelations.sql

3. Edit the bulk_qeury.sql file.  

Enter full folder path of dimension files in all sections of the bulk qeury file where you find "Enter Full folder path containing .csv file". 

3 a) These dimension and fact table files can be found in the CSV files folder. 

3 b) Or run Extraction_Transformation to obtain new CSV dimension and fact tables in the current folder and use that as path for bulk query.


Extraction_Transformation is a jupyter notebook file which creates dimensions and fact tables (already provided in CSV files folder)
Extraction_Transformation depends on having reed.csv and seek.csv files in the current folder(provided).
